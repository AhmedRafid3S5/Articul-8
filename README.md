## Articul 8
Source Code & Links for 5DOF robotic arm. 
The robotic arm is made using a simplified arm structure offering 5 degrees of freedom. To enable the arm to carry light payloads, the structure was designed to minimize the load of servo the arm must bear. Most of the actuators are mounted at the base.
- A cardboard structure was chosen to reduce costing. 
- An Arduino UNO board is used to control all 5 servos. The servo analog pins were attached to pwm supported pins of the Arduino.
- A 65 W mobile charger was used as the power supply to provide adequate current to each servo.
- Controller buttons and analog sticks were mapped to each servo following this video tutorial. [Link](https://youtu.be/MUM8_4mWxng?si=NTlPSBIOiS2_CPuv)
